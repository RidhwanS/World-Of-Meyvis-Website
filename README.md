# Map-Display
I end up creating a lot of maps for the various dungeons and dragon campaigns that I run. Sometimes I end up losing them and thats a real bummer. So this is sort of an archive for them.

I have always been interested in trying to create a website for my campaigns that would allow players to interact and do searching on the various locations in the image. This is my first steps toward that end goal.

Also this is a good way to brush up on web development skills a bit

For this I used the bootstrap template Freelance, You can find some details below
